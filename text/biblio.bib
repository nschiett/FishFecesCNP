abstract = {Coral microbiomes are sensitive to multiple physical and biotic stressors that can increase host susceptibility to dysbiosis, leading to bleaching and mortality. While the factors that drive coral dysbiosis are complex and still not well understood, a number of mechanisms may facilitate transmission of opportunistic bacteria. For instance, several marine invertebrates and fishes are suspected to act as microbial vectors through corallivory, as well as via fecal transmission of microbes. Here, we used a factorial manipulative experiment to test the interactive effects of feces deposition by a common surgeonfish Ctenochaetus striatus and mechanical wounding (mimicking corallivory) on microbial communities of the coral Porites lobata. We found that exposure of unwounded and wounded corals to fish feces induced an increase in microbial richness and diversity of 1.5- and 2-fold, respectively, and resulted in greater abundance of potential opportunists (e.g. Rhodobacteraceae, Verrucomicrobiaceae, Flavobacteriaceae, Vibrionaceae, Fusobacteriaceae). Many of these opportunists were also found in C. striatus feces. While microbial communities in corals exposed to individual stressors tended to shift back to their original composition at the end of the 48 h experiment, the persistence of potential opportunists (e.g. Vibrionaceae, Campylobacteraceae, Cohaesibacteraceae) when feces and wounding were combined indicates that impacts to the coral microbiome may be exacerbated when stressors interact. Our results suggest that fish feces may represent a novel route of transmission of microbes and/or facilitate the enrichment of potentially opportunistic and pathogenic bacteria within reef-building corals. Further, interactions with other common stressors such as corallivory might worsen these impacts, increasing dysbiosis and ultimately affecting coral health.},

abstract = {Nutrient recycling by consumers can strongly impact nutrient availability for autotrophic and heterotrophic microbes, thus impacting functions such as primary production and decomposition. Filter-feeding freshwater mussels form dense, multispecies assemblages in aquatic ecosystems and have been shown to play a critical role in nutrient cycling. Mussel excretion can enhance benthic primary production and influence algal species composition. However, the role of mussels in brown or detritus-based food webs and species-specific differences has received considerably less attention. Here, using mesocosm experiments, we assessed how three species of freshwater mussels that occupy three different phylogenetic tribes influenced benthic algal accrual, ecosystem metabolism, cotton strip decomposition, leaf litter (Acer saccharum) decomposition, and litter-associated fungal biomass measured as ergosterol. Additionally, we measured mussel excretion and biodeposition rates and assessed the stoichiometry (C:N, C:P, and N:P) of the benthic algae, cotton strips, and leaf litter. In comparison to controls without mussels, generally, mussel treatments had higher benthic algal biomass composed of more diatoms, higher gross primary productivity and net ecosystem production rates, and higher cotton strip tensile strength loss, but there was not a difference in ecosystem respiration rates, leaf litter decomposition rates, or fungal biomass. Benthic algae had lower C:N and higher N:P in mussel treatment tanks and cotton strip C:N was lower in mesocosms with mussels. Our results suggest that nutrient regeneration by mussels most strongly regulates green food webs, with some impacts to brown food webs, suggesting that consumers have interactive effects on microbial functioning in freshwaters.},

abstract = {The elemental carbon (C), nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) compositions of the whole-body and gut content of wild marine fish inhabiting the Bay of Biscay (Northeast Atlantic) were studied. Furthermore, the literature was examined for studies of aquacultured fish, reporting the elemental composition of the whole-body fish, that of their food, and nutrient assimilation and gross growth efficiencies (GGE). In both wild-caught and aquacultured fish, significant differences in C, N and P elemental composition were found between species, with P being the most variable component. Differences among species in terms of C, N and P content could be explained by varying proportions of storage compounds in whole-body fish, and varying degrees of ossification. Aquacultured fish feces were found to be P-rich, because of a lower P assimilation efficiency, compared to C or N assimilation efficiencies. Examination of aquacultured fish literature also revealed that C, N and P GGE and nutrient resupply ratios agreed with basic principles of homeostatic regulation of whole-body fish elemental composition. Extrapolation of the results to broader marine systems indicated that fish may be important for conveying nutrients toward the ocean interior. {\textcopyright} 2011 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract = {In ecosystems where excretion by fish is a major flux of nutrients, the nitrogen (N) to phosphorus (P) ratio released by fish can be important in shaping patterns of algal biomass, community composition, primary production, and nutrient limitation. Demand for N and P as well as energy influences N/P excretion ratios and has broad implications in ecosystems where nutrient recycling by fishes is substantial. Bioenergetics and stoichiometric models predict that natural fish populations are generally energy-limited and therefore N/P recycling by fishes is relatively invariant. Yet, the potential for P limitation of growth has not been examined in herbivorous fishes, which are common in many aquatic habitats. We examined N/P excretion ratios and P demand in two P-rich herbivorous catfishes of the family Loricariidae, Ancistrus triradiatus (hereafter Ancistrus) and Chaetostoma milesi (hereafter Chaetostoma). Both fishes are common grazers in the Andean piedmont region of Venezuela where we conducted this study. Mass balance (MB) models indicate that these fishes have a high P demand. In fact, our Ancistrus' P MB model predicted negative P excretion rates, indicating that Ancistrus did not consume enough P to meet its P demand for growth. Direct measurement of excretion rates showed positive, but very low P excretion rates and high N/P excretion ratios for both taxa. To obtain measured P excretion rates of Ancistrus from the MB model, gross growth efficiency must be reduced by 90{\%}. Our results suggest that growth rates of both of these herbivorous and P-rich fish are likely P-limited. If P limitation of growth is common among herbivorous fish populations, herbivorous fishes recycle likely at high N/P ratios and act to diminish the quality of their food.},

abstract = {Reconciling the degree to which ecological processes are generalizable among taxa and ecosystems, or contingent on the identity of interacting species, remains a critical challenge in ecology. Ecological stoichiometry (EST) and metabolic theory of ecology (MTE) are theoretical approaches used to evaluate how consumers mediate nutrient dynamics and energy flow through ecosystems. Recent theoretical work has explored the utility of these theories, but empirical tests in species-rich ecological communities remain scarce. Here we use an unprecedented dataset collected from fishes and dominant invertebrates (n = 900) in a diverse subtropical coastal marine community (50 families, 72 genera, 102 species; body mass range: 0.04-2,597 g) to test the utility of EST and MTE in predicting excretion rates of nitrogen (E(N)), phosphorus (E(P)), and their ratio (E(NP)). Body mass explained a large amount of the variation in EN and EP but not E(NP). Strong evidence in support of the MTE 3/4 allometric scaling coefficient was found for E(P), and for E(N) only after accounting for variation in excretion rates among taxa. In all cases, including taxonomy in models substantially improved model performance, highlighting the importance of species identity for this ecosystem function. Body nutrient content and trophic position explained little of the variation in E(N), E(P), or E(NP), indicating limited applicability of basic predictors of EST. These results highlight the overriding importance of MTE for predicting nutrient flow through organisms, but emphasize that these relationships still fall short of explaining the unique effects certain species can have on ecological processes.},

abstract = {Dietary analyses of 17 species of nominally herbivorous fishes on the northern Great Barrier Reef were carried out to resolve the questions to what extent diet in nominally herbivorous reef fishes is dominated by living plant material and whether short-chain fatty acid profiles in the alimentary tract predict diet. The fishes included members of the families Acanthuridae, Scaridae and Kyphosidae. The analyses revealed consumption of a wide range of food resources including macroscopic algae, turfing algae, pelagic and planktonic animal matter, organic detritus and sediments. In only 7 of the 17 species was living algae the dominant dietary item. Gastrointestinal short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) profiles reflecting the fermentative activities of gut symbionts were used as a framework for the initial analysis of dietary patterns. The feeding patterns implied by the SCFA profiles were validated by direct observation of food material through gut content analysis. We identified four main trophic groupings differentiated by fermentation profiles and diet. These were: (1) species with low levels of SCFA in gut samples (mean mM 9.2 +/- 0.8) but a high proportion of isovalerate (mean 15.4{\%} +/- 4.7): Acanthurus nigricauda, A. olivaceits, Ctenochaetits striatus, Chlorurus microrhinos, C. sordidus, Scarus schlegeli; (2) species that fed on turfing, filamentous and small thallate algae and displayed moderate levels of SCFA (mean mM 21.9 +/- 2.9): Acanthurus nigricans, A.lineatus, Naso tuberosus; (3) species that fed on large thallate (macroscopic) algae with high levels of SCFA (mean mM 41.2 +/- 3.5) with very low proportions of isovalerate (mean 0.5{\%} +/- 0.1): Kyphosus cinerascens, K.vaigiensis, Naso unicornis, Zebrasoma scopas; and (4) species with diets dominated by planktonic animal material with moderate levels of SCFA (mean mM 21.3 +/- 1.5): Naso annulatus, N. brevirostris, N. hexacanthus, N. vlamingii. We conclude that a wide range of dietary items are taken by the 17 nominal herbivores, and that dietary groupings do not reflect taxonomic relationships. There was evidence of convergence in feeding modes and diet between phylogenetically distinct taxa and divergence within particular lineages.},

abstract = {Corals thrive in low nutrient environments and the conservation of these globally imperiled ecosystems is largely dependent on mitigating the effects of anthropogenic nutrient enrichment. However, to better understand the implications of anthropogenic nutrients requires a heightened understanding of baseline nutrient dynamics within these ecosystems. Here, we provide a novel perspective on coral reef nutrient dynamics by examining the role of fish communities in the supply and storage of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P). We quantified fish-mediated nutrient storage and supply for 144 species and modeled these data onto 172 fish communities (71 729 individual fish), in four types of coral reefs, as well as seagrass and mangrove ecosystems, throughout the Northern Antilles. Fish communities supplied and stored large quantities of nutrients, with rates varying among ecosystem types. The size structure and diversity of the fish communities best predicted N and P supply and storage and N : P supply, suggesting that alterations to fish communities (e.g., overfishing) will have important implications for nutrient dynamics in these systems. The stoichiometric ratio (N : P) for storage in fish mass ({\~{}}8 : 1) and supply ({\~{}}20 : 1) was notably consistent across the four coral reef types (but not seagrass or mangrove ecosystems). Published nutrient enrichment studies on corals show that deviations from this N : P supply ratio may be associated with poor coral fitness, providing qualitative support for the hypothesis that corals and their symbionts may be adapted to specific ratios of nutrient supply. Consumer nutrient stoichiometry provides a baseline from which to better understand nutrient dynamics in coral reef and other coastal ecosystems, information that is greatly needed if we are to implement more effective measures to ensure the future health of the world's oceans.},

Specifically, we modelled five processes of nutrient storage (in biomass) and supply (via excretion) of nutrients, as well as a measure of their multifunctionality, onto 143 species of coral reef fishes across 110 coral reef fish communities. These communities span a gradient from extreme fishing pressure to protected areas with little to no fishing. We find that in fished sites fish-mediated nutrient capacity is reduced almost 50{\%}, despite no substantial changes in the number of species. Instead, changes in community size and trophic structure were the primary cause of shifts in ecosystem function. These findings suggest that a broader perspective that incorporates predictable impacts of fishing pressure on ecosystem function is imperative for effective coral reef conservation and management.},

We examined the amount of nitrogen, phosphorous, particulate organic carbon, and calories which these fishes deposited over the coral colonies that were their resting sites. Weight-specific rates of nitrogen excretion by grunts decreased with increasing fish size. Rates of phosphorous excretion were not related to fish size. Excretory products were rich in nitrogen (molar N:P=48), primarily ammonium, whereas fecal material was richer in phosphorus (N:P=8). Feces leeched over half of their phosphorous content within the first day. half of the daily excretion and defecation occurred during the first 4 h after grunts returned to the reef, in which time they doubled the amount of NH4- available to corals under calm conditions. Seasonal patterns of nutrient and particulate organic carbon (caloric) input to coral colonies varied with grunt biomass on the colony. The maximum input to colonies of Porites furcata from grunts occurred during August, which coincided with the time of highest coral growth rate. Grunts deposited an average of 164 and 251 mg m{\^{}}-2d{\^{}}-1 of particulate organic carbon (feces) on P. furcata and Acropora palmata colonies over which they rested, an energy supplement to the colonies of 0.8 and 1.2 kcal m{\^{}}-2d{\^{}}-1.

This model successfully predicted P(or) by comparison with previous estimates for yellow perch. YOY fish contributed more to limnetic nutrient cycling through excretion than older age-classes, and YOY fish could also serve as an important P sink relative to algal sinking losses. Volumetric P(or) by YOY yellow perch reached a maximum of 0.3 mug P.L-1.d-1; N excretion peaked at 10 mug N.L-1.d-1. The ratio of excreted N:P varied fourfold during the summer.

To determine the role of urchin fecal material in nutrient cycling and energy flow in the shallow rocky subtidal zone, we monitored the physical, chemical, and microbial degradation of urchin feces at 6, 9, 12, and 16 m depth over 19 d at a wave-exposed site on the Atlantic coast of Nova Scotia by quantifying changes in fecal biochemical composition, pellet size, and settling velocity. We observed an exponential loss of fecal material and rapid degradation of total and labile organic matter fractions; this suggests that urchin fecal production plays an important role in local nutrient cycling and energy flow via the microbial food web. As the feces were further degraded there was a relative increase in organic carbon, nitrogen, lipid, and available energy content, and a decrease in the C:N ratio, suggesting that degraded urchin feces are an important food source for suspension- and deposit-feeding invertebrates. The settling velocity of the feces also decreased over time, likely due to a decrease in fecal pellet density. Older, less dense feces with a relatively high energy content are more likely to be suspended and transported horizontally, providing a mechanism for the export of kelp primary production to deeper, less productive waters. {\textcopyright} Inter-Research 2009.},

Animal-mediated nutrient sources are particularly important in nutrient-poor systems such as coral reefs. However, aggregations of mobile animals might lead to temporal and spatial variability in local nutrient availability, which is not well understood. In this study, we quantified how patterns of fish movement and abundance influence the stability of nitrogen provisioning on Bahamian coral reefs. We empirically mea- sured and modeled nitrogen excretion estimates for 16 coral reef fish communities and combined these measurements with fish abundance and behavioral observations to compare reef nutrient budgets on diel, monthly, and annual time scales. Diel reef nitrogen provisioning by fishes varied greatly, with diurnal rates being on average four times greater than nocturnal rates. Diurnal rates were highly variable among reefs and were driven primarily by migratory grunts (Haemulidae) resting over reefs during the day but forag- ing off reefs at night. At the reef scale, overall nitrogen excretion rates were correlated with grunt abun- dance; however, grunt abundance could not be predicted by any reef physical characteristics. Within-reef grunt excretion rates changed little across a 4-month period but varied significantly over two years, indi- cating that nutrient supply on a patch reef is not stable over long periods of time. Quantifying how nutrient provisioning on patch reefs is linked to fish activity and movement patterns and how provisioning varies on different spatial and temporal scales is important for understanding overall patterns of primary productivity on reefs.},

abstract = {The flux of consumer-derived nutrients is recognized as an important ecosystem process, yet few studies have quantified the impact of these fluxes on freshwater ecosystems. The high abundance of bivalves in both marine and freshwater suggests that bivalves can exert large effects on aquatic food webs. The objective of our study was to determine the importance of unionid mussel-derived nitrogen (MDN) to the food web. We used a stable isotope tracer approach in conjunction with nutrient uptake and excretion experiments. We fed mussels (Lampsilis siliquiodea, n = 249) a 15N-enriched algal diet and placed them into a N-limited stream for 63 days. Mussel hemolymph was non-lethally sampled over the course of the experiment to measure tissue turnover of $\delta$15N and excretion experiments were done to model the amount of N mussels provided in comparison to stream N uptake demand. Multiple food web pools were sampled twice prior and five times following the mussel addition to trace the 15N through the food web. Our mussel excretion rates in comparison to areal uptake demand suggested that mussel excretion can account for 40{\%} of the total N demand in this stream. Our enrichment showed that MDN was entering the food web and supplied up to 19{\%} of the N in specific compartments of the food web near the mussel bed. When scaled to a natural mussel aggregation, our results suggest up to 74{\%} of N in the food web may be mussel-derived. Our results show that N supplied by mussels can be an important nutrient subsidy that provides food web support. {\textcopyright} 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract = {Nominally herbivorous acanthurids (surgeonfishes) and scarids (parrotfishes) have often been considered a 'homogeneous' functional group that consumes and digests algae. Recent work demonstrates that many of these fishes consume detritus. The objective of this study was to investigate the composition of dietary nutrients targeted by these and other fishes in terms of feeding behaviour, diet and short chain fatty acids (SCFA). We undertook a nutritional analysis of a range of species including detritivores, algivores, omnivores and planktivores from north eastern Australia. We calculated assimilation efficiencies for total protein amino acids (TAA), carbohydrate and lipid, and measured TAA in gut fluid along the intestine. Nutrients were assimilated similarly to their dietary proportions, with planktivores assimilating a high proportion of TAA, a moderate proportion of lipid and little carbohydrate. Omnivores assimilated moderate proportions of TAA and carbohydrate, and a low proportion of lipid. Algivores assimilated a low proportion of TAA and lipid, but a high proportion of carbohydrate. Detritivorous scarids and acanthurids differed significantly from algivores, assimilating a high proportion of TAA, a low proportion of carbohydrate and a moderate proportion of lipid. TAA levels in gut fluid of all species were highest in the anterior and lowest in the posterior intestine. Gut segments with highest TAA values were compared between dietary groups and followed a similar trend to TAA assimilation. Planktivores had high concentrations of TAA, while omnivores had intermediate, and algivores the lowest, concentrations. The highest gut fluid TAA concentrations were found in detritivorous scarids and acanthurids, and were significantly higher than in algivores. A significant negative correlation was found between anterior intestinal fluid TAA and posterior intestinal SCFA values. Detritivores had the highest levels of TAA but the lowest levels of SCFA. Planktivorous species had high levels of TAA and low to intermediate levels of SCFA. Omnivores had moderate levels of both TAA and SCFA. Algivores had low levels of TAA but high levels of SCFA. This indicates that there are major differences in the food resources targeted by detritivorous and algivorous fish species on coral reefs.},

abstract = {During destructive grazing events in the Northwest Atlantic, sea urchins Strongylocentrotus droebachiensis consume large amounts of kelp biomass, transforming this material into feces. To determine the role of urchin fecal material in nutrient cycling and energy flow in the shallow rocky subtidal zone, we monitored the physical, chemical, and microbial degradation of urchin feces at 6, 9, 12, and 16 m depth over 19 d at a wave-exposed site on the Atlantic coast of Nova Scotia by quantifying changes in fecal biochemical composition, pellet size, and settling velocity. We observed an exponential loss of fecal material and rapid degradation of total and labile organic matter fractions; this suggests that urchin fecal production plays an important role in local nutrient cycling and energy flow via the microbial food web. As the feces were further degraded there was a relative increase in organic carbon, nitrogen, lipid, and available energy content, and a decrease in the C:N ratio, suggesting that degraded urchin feces are an important food source for suspension- and deposit-feeding invertebrates. The settling velocity of the feces also decreased over time, likely due to a decrease in fecal pellet density. Older, less dense feces with a relatively high energy content are more likely to be suspended and transported horizontally, providing a mechanism for the export of kelp primary production to deeper, less productive waters. {\textcopyright} Inter-Research 2009.},

abstract = {Resource quantity and quality are fundamental bottom-up constraints on consumers. Best understood in autotroph-based systems, co-occurrence of these constraints may be common but remains poorly studied in detrital-based systems. Here, we used a laboratory growth experiment to test limitation of the detritivorous caddisfly larvae Pycnopsyche lepida across a concurrent gradient of oak litter quantity (food supply) and quality (phosphorus : carbon [P:C ratios]). Growth increased simultaneously with quantity and quality, indicating co-limitation across the resource gradients. We merged approaches of ecological stoichiometry and co-limitation theory, showing how co-limitation reflected shifts in C and P acquisition throughout homeostatic regulation. Increased growth was best explained by elevated consumption rates and improved P assimilation, which both increased with elevated quantity and quality. Notably, C assimilation efficiencies remained unchanged and achieved maximum 18{\%} at low quantity despite pronounced C limitation. Detrital C recalcitrance and substantive post-assimilatory C losses probably set a minimum quantity threshold to achieve positive C balance. Above this threshold, greater quality enhanced larval growth probably by improving P assimilation toward P-intensive growth. We suggest this interplay of C and P acquisition contributes to detritivore co-limitation, highlighting quantity and quality as potential simultaneous bottom-up controls in detrital-based ecosystems, including under anthropogenic change like nutrient enrichment.},

abstract = {The elemental carbon (C), nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) compositions of the whole-body and gut content of wild marine fish inhabiting the Bay of Biscay (Northeast Atlantic) were studied. Furthermore, the literature was examined for studies of aquacultured fish, reporting the elemental composition of the whole-body fish, that of their food, and nutrient assimilation and gross growth efficiencies (GGE). In both wild-caught and aquacultured fish, significant differences in C, N and P elemental composition were found between species, with P being the most variable component. Differences among species in terms of C, N and P content could be explained by varying proportions of storage compounds in whole-body fish, and varying degrees of ossification. Aquacultured fish feces were found to be P-rich, because of a lower P assimilation efficiency, compared to C or N assimilation efficiencies. Examination of aquacultured fish literature also revealed that C, N and P GGE and nutrient resupply ratios agreed with basic principles of homeostatic regulation of whole-body fish elemental composition. Extrapolation of the results to broader marine systems indicated that fish may be important for conveying nutrients toward the ocean interior. {\textcopyright} 2011 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract = {Analysis of stomach contents of Stegastes lividus revealed a shift from omnivory in juveniles to herbivory in adults. Red algae, primarily Polysiphonia spp., Gelidiopsis intricata and Ceramium spp., formed the bulk of the diet in all size classes. Foraminifera and small crustaceans were of particular importance in the diet of juveniles. Net nitrogen assimilation efficiency of field-fed S. lividus was approximately 61{\%}, and did not vary with fish size. The net assimilation efficiencies of fish fed on Enteromorpha in the laboratory ranged from size-class means of 36-79{\%} for nitrogen and from 29-72{\%} for total organic material, and increased from juveniles to adults. Apparently, juveniles compensate for a lower efficiency in assimilating plant food by including a higher percentage of animal material in their natural diets. The ratios of intestine length to standard length (IL/SL) and to intestine diameter (IL/ID) increased rapidly in juveniles and leveled off in adults. The retention time for ingested food items may only be about one-half as long in juveniles as in adults. The combination of observed IL/ID ratios and estimated retention times proved most valuable in the interpretation of ontogenetic changes in feeding habits and assimilation efficiency. {\textcopyright} 1984 Dr W.

abstract = {Abstract Energy flow and nutrient cycling dictate the functional role of organisms in ecosystems. Fishes are key vectors of carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P) in aquatic systems, and the quantification of elemental fluxes is often achieved by coupling bioenergetics and stoichiometry. While nutrient limitation has been accounted for in several stoichiometric models, there is no current implementation that permits its incorporation into a bioenergetics approach to predict consumption rates. This may lead to biased estimates of elemental fluxes. Here, we introduce a theoretical framework that combines stoichiometry and bioenergetics with explicit consideration of elemental limitations. We examine varying elemental limitations across different trophic groups and life stages through a case study of three trophically-distinct reef fishes. Further, we empirically validate our model using an independent database of measured excretion rates. Our model adequately predicts elemental fluxes in the examined species and reveals species- and size-specific limitations of C, N, and P. In line with theoretical predictions, we demonstrate that the herbivore Zebrasoma scopas is limited by N and P, and all three fish species are limited by P in early life stages. Further, we show that failing to account for nutrient limitation can result in a greater than two-fold underestimation of ingestion rates, which leads to severely biased excretion rates. Our model improved predictions of ingestion, excretion, and egestion rates across all life stages, especially for fishes with diets low in N and/or P. Due to its broad applicability, its reliance on many parameters that are well defined and widely accessible, and its straightforward implementation via the accompanying R-package fishflux, our model provides a user-friendly path toward a better understanding of ecosystem-wide nutrient cycling in the aquatic biome.},

abstract = {Fishes are important pools of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P), and they have important direct and indirect effects on cycling of these potentially limiting nutrients in lakes. We used a model of fish bioenergetics coupled to a mass balance model of fish N and P budgets to investigate the stoichiometric interactions among fishes, their food, and the nutrient recycling that results from this predator–prey interaction. We tested the hy-pothesis that the N:P ratios in fish excretion (supply ratios) are high but potentially variable because of fishes' high P requirement and the likelihood of P limitation of fish growth. A survey of 186 cases representing 18 fish species demonstrated that limitation of fish growth due to availability of P in food was exceedingly rare in natural ecosystems. Fish growth rates were energy limited in almost all systems. Fish grew at an average of 26{\%} of the maximum potential rate determined from bioenergetics. As a result, the predicted N:P supply ratio from fish excretion was low and relatively constant (the median mass ratio for pis-civores was 6.1, and 13.1 for all other fishes). Excretion rates for N and P by fishes were predictable from body size, food nutrient concentration, and environmental temperature. Nutrient recycling by fishes will tend to alleviate P limitation of phytoplankton growth, but the importance of this effect will be directly proportional to the magnitude of nutrient regeneration rates from fishes relative to other sources available to phytoplankton.},

abstract = {Hippopotami can play a significant role as ecosystem engineers and may play an important role as carbon and nutrient vectors from savanna grasslands to aquatic systems. We coupled the results of a feeding study of captive hippopotami, faeces leaching/mineralisation experiments, hippopotamus consumption estimates and the stoichiometry of savanna grasses to calculate excretion and egestion rates of hippopotami. We then used time budgets and population estimates to calculate nutrient loading by hippopotami in the Mara River, Kenya. In captivity, hippopotami consumed 11.0 g dry matter (DM) kg hippopotamus-1 day-1 (110.6 C; 6.8 N; 1.0 P) and egested 5.3 g DM kg-1 day-1. They excreted or egested 2.72 g C, 0.28 g N and 0.04 g P kg hippopotamus-1 day-1, and urine comprised 12{\%} of C, 70{\%} of N and 33{\%} of P of total excretion and egestion. By integrating data from previously published work on hippopotamus digestion with the data we collected in the field, we estimated an average hippopotamus in the Mara River would excrete or egest 1.93-3.58 g DM, 0.78-1.47 g C, 0.13-0.19 g N and 0.01-0.02 g P kg hippopotamus-1 day-1, and that half of this excretion/egestion would enter the river. The hippopotamus population increased by 1500{\%} inside the Maasai Mara National Reserve, Kenya, between 1959 and 2006. We estimate that hippopotami egest 36 200 kg faeces day-1 into the Mara River (wet mass). Daily loading into the river by excretion and egestion equals 8563 kg DM, 3499 kg C, 492 kg N and 48 kg P, which is equivalent to 670{\%} of CPOM, 15{\%} of DOC, 27{\%} of TN and 29{\%} of TP of loading from the upstream catchment. This research provides the first estimates for hippopotamus inputs to rivers that include both excretion and egestion and provides evidence that hippopotami are important resource vectors in sub-Saharan African rivers, even when compared to other sources of carbon and nutrients.},

abstract = {Dysbiosis of coral microbiomes results from various biotic and environmental stressors, including interactions with important reef fishes which may act as vectors of opportunistic microbes via deposition of fecal material. Additionally, elevated sea surface temperatures have direct effects on coral microbiomes by promoting growth and virulence of opportunists and putative pathogens, thereby altering host immunity and health. However, interactions between these biotic and abiotic factors have yet to be evaluated. Here, we used a factorial experiment to investigate the combined effects of fecal pellet deposition by the widely distributed surgeonfish Ctenochaetus striatus and elevated sea surface temperatures on microbiomes associated with the reef-building coral Porites lobata . Our results showed that regardless of temperature, exposure of P. lobata to C. striatus feces increased alpha diversity, dispersion, and lead to a shift in microbial community composition – all indicative of microbial dysbiosis. Although elevated temperature did not result in significant changes in alpha and beta diversity, we noted an increasing number of differentially abundant taxa in corals exposed to both feces and thermal stress within the first 48h of the experiment. These included opportunistic microbial lineages and taxa closely related to potential coral pathogens (i.e., Vibrio vulnificus , Photobacterium rosenbergii ). Some of these taxa were absent in controls but present in surgeonfish feces under both temperature regimes, suggesting mechanisms of microbial transmission and/or enrichment from fish feces to corals. Importantly, the impact to coral microbiomes by fish feces under higher temperatures appeared to inhibit wound healing in corals, as percentages of tissue recovery at the site of feces deposition were lower at 30°C compared to 26°C. Lower percentages of tissue recovery were associated with greater relative abundance of several bacterial lineages, with some of them found in surgeonfish feces (i.e., Rhodobacteraceae, Bdellovibrionaceae, Crocinitomicaceae). Our findings suggest that fish feces interact with elevated sea surface temperatures to favor microbial opportunism and enhance dysbiosis susceptibility in P. lobata . As the frequency and duration of thermal stress related events increase, the ability of coral microbiomes to recover from biotic stressors such as deposition of fish feces may be greatly affected, ultimately compromising coral health and resilience.},

abstract = {Zooplankton fecal pellets have long been thought to be a dominant component of the sedimentary flux in marine and freshwater ecosystems, but that view is changing. The last 2 decades have seen publication of {\textgreater}500 studies using sediment traps, which reveal that zooplankton fecal pellets often constitute only a minor or variable proportion of the sedimentary flux. Substantial proportions of this flux are from organic aggregates ('marine snow') of various origins, including phytoplankton blooms, which sediment directly to the benthos. It now appears that mainly large fecal pellets of macrozooplankton and fish are involved in the sedimentary flux. Smaller fecal pellets of microzooplankton and small mesozooplankton are mostly recycled or repackaged in the water column by microbial decomposition and coprophagy, contributing more to processes in the water column than flux to the benthos. The relative contributions of fecal pellets, marine snow and sinking phytoplankton to the vertical flux and recycling of materials in the water column are highly variable, dependent upon multiple interacting factors. These include variations in productivity, biomass, size spectra and composition of communities in the overlying water columns, and trophic interactions between various components of the plankton and nekton communities at various times, locations and depths. Other factors include differences in sinking rates, sizes, composition and pollutant contents of fecal pellets produced by various sizes of zooplankters, and zooplankton feeding-fecal pellet production interactions in relation to upwelling and El Ni{\~{n}}o periods, seasonal life-history-related zooplankton vertical migrations and long-term oceanographic regime shifts. There are also suggestions from the geological record that zooplankton fecal pellets may have been important in ancient oceans. The ecological roles of marine snow and phytoplankton aggregates in sedimentary flux also depend on a variety of interacting factors, including sources of origin, degrees of microbial colonization, depth distributions, sinking rates and ingestibility by consumers. Perhaps the major reversal of the previous paradigm on the role of fecal pellets in the sedimentary flux over the last 2 decades has been the realization that much, if not most, of the organic rain from the epipelagic to the abyss is due to direct sedimentation of aggregated phytoplankton, which does not appear to undergo consumption in the water column, and which may be related to seasonality of surface production cycles. Further, there is emerging evidence for benthic responses to sedimented phytodetritus, including apparent synchrony of reproductive cycles of some deep-sea benthic animals with seasonality of sinking of surface blooms. Such episodic input of surface phytodetritus may help resolve apparent discrepancies between average supply and demand of organic matter required to maintain benthic community metabolism. The sedimentary flux of fecal pellets, marine snow and sinking phytoplankton is an important component of the biological pump that not only transports and recycles materials in the sea but also may help scrub greenhouse gases from the atmosphere.},

abstract = {The framework of ecological stoichiometry was developed primarily within the context of "green" autotroph-based food webs. While stoichiometric principles also apply in "brown" detritus-based systems, these systems have been historically understudied and differ from green ones in several important aspects including carbon (C) quality and the nutrient [nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P)] contents of food resources for consumers. In this paper, we review work over the last decade that has advanced the application of ecological stoichiometry from green to brown food webs, focusing on freshwater ecosystems. We first review three focal areas where green and brown food webs differ: (1) bottom-up controls by light and nutrient availability, (2) stoichiometric constraints on consumer growth and nutritional regulation, and (3) patterns in consumer-driven nutrient dynamics. Our review highlights the need for further study of how light and nutrient availability affect autotroph-heterotroph interactions on detritus and the subsequent effects on consumer feeding and growth. To complement this conceptual review, we formally quantified differences in stoichiometric principles between green and brown food webs using a meta-analysis across feeding studies of freshwater benthic invertebrates. From 257 datasets collated across 46 publications and several unpublished studies, we compared effect sizes (Pearson's r) of resource N:C and P:C on growth, consumption, excretion, and egestion between herbivorous and detritivorous consumers. The meta-analysis revealed that both herbivore and detritivore growth are limited by resource N:C and P:C contents, but effect sizes only among detritivores were significantly above zero. Consumption effect sizes were negative among herbivores but positive for detritivores in the case of both N:C and P:C, indicating distinct compensatory feeding responses across resource stoichiometry gradients. Herbivore P excretion rates responded significantly positively to resource P:C, whereas detritivore N and P excretion did not respond; detritivore N and P egestion responded positively to resource N:C and P:C, respectively. Our meta-analysis highlights resource N and P contents as broadly limiting in brown and green benthic food webs, but indicates contrasting mechanisms of limitation owing to differing consumer regulation. We suggest that green and brown food webs share fundamental stoichiometric principles, while identifying specific differences toward applying ecological stoichiometry across ecosystems.},

abstract = {Increased frequency of disturbances and anthropogenic activities are predicted to have a devastating impact on coral reefs that will ultimately change the composition of reef associated fish communities. We reviewed and analysed studies that document the effects of disturbance-mediated coral loss on coral reef fishes. Meta-analysis of 17 independent studies revealed that 62{\%} of fish species declined in abundance within 3 years of disturbances that resulted in {\textgreater}10{\%} decline in coral cover. Abundances of species reliant on live coral for food and shelter consistently declined during this time frame, while abundance of some species that feed on invertebrates, algae and/or detritus increased. The response of species, particularly those expected to benefit from the immediate loss of coral, is, however, variable and is attributed to erratic replenishment of stocks, ecological versatility of species and sublethal responses, such as changes in growth, body condition and feeding rates. The diversity of fish communities was found to be negatively and linearly correlated to disturbance-mediated coral loss. Coral loss {\textgreater}20{\%} typically resulted in a decline in species richness of fish communities, although diversity may initially increase following small declines in coral cover from high coverage. Disturbances that result in an immediate loss of habitat complexity (e.g. severe tropical storms), have a greater impact on fishes from all trophic levels, compared with disturbances that kill corals, but leave the reef framework intact (e.g. coral bleaching and outbreaks of Acanthaster planci). This is most evident among small bodied species and suggests the long-term consequences of coral loss through coral bleaching and crown-of-thorn starfish outbreaks may be much more substantial than the short-term effects currently documented. {\textcopyright} 2006 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {Global warming is markedly changing diverse coral reef ecosystems through an increasing frequency and magnitude of mass bleaching events1–3. How local impacts scale up across affected regions depends on numerous factors, including patchiness in coral mortality, metabolic effects of extreme temperatures on populations of reef-dwelling species4 and interactions between taxa. Here we use data from before and after the 2016 mass bleaching event to evaluate ecological changes in corals, algae, fishes and mobile invertebrates at 186 sites along the full latitudinal span of the Great Barrier Reef and western Coral Sea. One year after the bleaching event, reductions in live coral cover of up to 51{\%} were observed on surveyed reefs that experienced extreme temperatures; however, regional patterns of coral mortality were patchy. Consistent declines in coral-feeding fishes were evident at the most heavily affected reefs, whereas few other short-term responses of reef fishes and invertebrates could be attributed directly to changes in coral cover. Nevertheless, substantial region-wide ecological changes occurred that were mostly independent of coral loss, and instead appeared to be linked directly to sea temperatures. Community-wide trophic restructuring was evident, with weakening of strong pre-existing latitudinal gradients in the diversity of fishes, invertebrates and their functional groups. In particular, fishes that scrape algae from reef surfaces, which are considered to be important for recovery after bleaching2, declined on northern reefs, whereas other herbivorous groups increased on southern reefs. The full impact of the 2016 bleaching event may not be realized until dead corals erode during the next decade5,6. However, our short-term observations suggest that the recovery processes, and the ultimate scale of impact, are affected by functional changes in communities, which in turn depend on the thermal affinities of local reef-associated fauna. Such changes will vary geographically, and may be particularly acute at locations where many fishes and invertebrates are close to their thermal distribution limits7.},

abstract = {1. The concept of plant functional type proposes that species can be grouped according to common responses to the environment and/or common effects on ecosystem processes. However, the knowledge of relationships between traits associated with the response of plants to environmental factors such as resources and disturbances (response traits), and traits that determine effects of plants on ecosystem functions (effect traits), such as biogeochemical cycling or propensity to disturbance, remains rudimentary. 2. We present a framework using concepts and results from community ecology, ecosystem ecology and evolutionary biology to provide this linkage. Ecosystem functioning is the end result of the operation of multiple environmental filters in a hierarchy of scales which, by selecting individuals with appropriate responses, result in assemblages with varying trait composition. Functional linkages and trade-offs among traits, each of which relates to one or several processes, determine whether or not filtering by different factors gives a match, and whether ecosystem effects can be easily deduced from the knowledge of the filters. 3. To illustrate this framework we analyse a set of key environmental factors and ecosystem processes. While traits associated with response to nutrient gradients strongly overlapped with those determining net primary production, little direct overlap was found between response to fire and flammability. 4. We hypothesize that these patterns reflect general trends. Responses to resource availability would be determined by traits that are also involved in biogeochemical cycling, because both these responses and effects are driven by the trade-off between acquisition and conservation. On the other hand, regeneration and demographic traits associated with response to disturbance, which are known to have little connection with adult traits involved in plant ecophysiology, would be of little relevance to ecosystem processes. 5. This framework is likely to be broadly applicable, although caution must be exercised to use trait linkages and trade-offs appropriate to the scale, environmental conditions and evolutionary context. It may direct the selection of plant functional types for vegetation models at a range of scales, and help with the design of experimental studies of relationships between plant diversity and ecosystem properties.},

abstract = {The role of animals in modulating nutrient cycling [hereafter, consumer-driven nutrient dynamics (CND)] has been accepted as an important influence on both community structure and ecosystem function in aquatic systems. Yet there is great variability in the influence of CND across species and ecosystems, and the causes of this variation are not well understood. Here, we review and synthesize the mechanisms behind CND in fresh waters. We reviewed 131 articles on CND published between 1973 and 1 June 2015. The rate of new publications in CND has increased from 1.4 papers per year during 1973–2002 to 7.3 per year during 2003–2015. The majority of investigations are in North America with many concentrating on fish. More recent studies have focused on animal-mediated nutrient excretion rates relative to nutrient demand and indirect impacts (e.g. decomposition). We identified several mechanisms that influence CND across levels of biological organization. Factors affecting the stoichiometric plasticity of consumers, including body size, feeding history and ontogeny, play an important role in determining the impact of individual consumers on nutrient dynamics and underlie the stoichiometry of CND across time and space. The abiotic characteristics of an ecosystem affect the net impact of consumers on ecosystem processes by influencing consumer metabolic processes (e.g. consumption and excretion/egestion rates), non-CND supply of nutrients and ecosystem nutrient demand. Furthermore, the transformation and transport of elements by populations and communities of consumers also influences the flow of energy and nutrients across ecosystem boundaries. This review highlights that shifts in community composition or biomass of consumers and eco-evolutionary underpinnings can have strong effects on the functional role of consumers in ecosystem processes, yet these are relatively unexplored aspects of CND. Future research should evaluate the value of using species traits and abiotic conditions to predict and understand the effects of consumers on ecosystem-level nutrient dynamics across temporal and spatial scales. Moreover, new work in CND should strive to integrate knowledge from disparate fields of ecology and environmental science, such as physiology and ecosystem ecology, to develop a comprehensive and mechanistic understanding of the functional role of consumers. Comparative and experimental studies that develop testable hypotheses to challenge the current assumptions of CND, including consumer stoichiometric homeostasis, are needed to assess the significance of CND among species and across freshwater ecosystems.},

abstract = {Improving coral reef conservation requires heightened understanding of the mechanisms by which coral cope with changing environmental conditions to maintain optimal health. We used a long-term (10 month) in situ experiment with two phylogenetically diverse scleractinians (Acropora palmata and Porites porites) to test how coral–symbiotic algal interactions changed under real-world conditions that were a priori expected to be beneficial (fish-mediated nutrients) and to be harmful, but non-lethal, for coral (fish + anthropogenic nutrients). Analyzing nine response variables of nutrient stoichiometry and stable isotopes per coral fragment, we found that nutrients from fish positively affected coral growth, and moderate doses of anthropogenic nutrients had no additional effects. While growing, coral maintained homeostasis in their nutrient pools, showing tolerance to the different nutrient regimes. Nonetheless, structural equation models revealed more nuanced relationships, showing that anthropogenic nutrients reduced the diversity of coral–symbiotic algal interactions and caused nutrient and carbon flow to be dominated by the symbiont. Our findings show that nutrient and carbon pathways are fundamentally “rewired” under anthropogenic nutrient regimes in ways that could increase corals' susceptibility to further stressors. We hypothesize that our experiment captured coral in a previously unrecognized transition state between mutualism and antagonism. These findings highlight a notable parallel between how anthropogenic nutrients promote symbiont dominance with the holobiont, and how they promote macroalgal dominance at the coral reef scale. Our findings suggest more realistic experimental conditions, including studies across gradients of anthropogenic nutrient enrichment as well as the incorporation of varied nutrient and energy pathways, may facilitate conservation efforts to mitigate coral loss.},

abstract = {The epilithic algal matrix ({\{}EAM){\}} is a ubiquitous component of coral reefs and is the primary grazing surface for many reef fishes. Detritus accounts for at least 10{\%} to 78{\%} of all the organic matter present in the {\{}EAM{\}}, variation being attributed to hydrodynamic forces such as wave energy and biological elements such as algal morphology. When compared with filamentous algae, the other major source of organic matter in the {\{}EAM{\}}, protein: energy ratios, C: N ratios and total hydrolysable amino acids all suggest that detritus is of higher nutritional value than the algae. Lipid biomarkers indicate that more than 70{\%} of the detritus is derived from the filamentous algae but the addition of bacteria and microalgae add essential nutrients and improve the nutritional value of the detritus. The detritus is typically of an amorphic form with protein: energy ratios which indicate that it is capable of sustaining fish growth. Detritus within the {\{}EAM{\}} may be derived from dissolved organic matter, which reduces refractory material, enhancing the palatability and digestibility of detritus relative to filamentous algae. Detritus in the {\{}EAM{\}} may also come from settling material and fish faeces. Studies that quantified the amount of detritus ingested by fishes have identified at least 24 species from five families that predominantly ingest detritus. These species represent some of the most widespread and abundant {\{}EAM{\}} feeding fishes on coral reefs. It is estimated that detritivorous fishes account for at least 20{\%} of individuals and 40{\%} of the biomass of an {\{}EAM-feeding{\}} fish assemblage on the Great Barrier Reef. Comparisons of ingested material with the {\{}EAM{\}} indicate that many of these species selectively feed on detritus, particularly the small, organic rich particles {\{}$\backslash$textless{\}} 125 mum. Furthermore, analysis of lipids in body tissues of blennies and assimilation of nutrients from the alimentary canal of scarids and acanthurids provide strong evidence that detritus is assimilated by coral reef fishes. Consequently, a large percentage of {\{}EAM-feeding{\}} fishes on coral reefs can unequivocally be classified as detritivores. The ingestion and assimilation of detritus by these fishes represents a significant pathway for transferring energy from within the {\{}EAM{\}} to secondary consumers, making detritivorous fishes a critically important component of coral reef trophodynamics.},

There is a growing consensus, however, that functional diversity, or the value and range of species traits, rather than species numbers per se, strongly determines ecosystem functioning. Despite its importance, and the fact that species diversity is often an inadequate surrogate, functional diversity has been studied in relatively few cases. Approaches based on species richness on the one hand, and on functional traits and types on the other, have been extremely productive in recent years, but attempts to connect their findings have been rare. Crossfertilization between these two approaches is a promising way of gaining mechanistic insight into the links between plant diversity and ecosystem processes and contributing to practical management for the conservation of diversity and ecosystem services.},

Some efficiency ratios are calculated from the data of natural communities, and it is shown that a rigorous analysis indicates that several widely held assumptions about trophic dynamics, such as the existence of progressive efficiencies of energy utilization at higher tropic levels, cannot be substantiated. The ideas of community efficiency and community productivity are discussed, and several new ways of calculating these, based upon a consideration of the net productivities of all trophic levels or populations, are suggested.

abstract = {Mimicry is a widely documented phenomenon in coral reef fishes, but the underlying relationships between mimics and models are poorly understood. Juveniles of the surgeonfish Acanthurus pyroferus mimic the coloration of different pygmy angelfish Centropyge spp. at different locations throughout the geographic range of the surgeonfish, while adopting a common species-specific coloration as adults. This study examines the ecological and behavioural relationships between A. pyroferus and one of its models, Centropyge vroliki, in Papua New Guinea. Surgeonfish underwent a transition from the juvenile (mimetic) coloration to the adult (non-mimetic) coloration when they reached the maximum size of the angelfish. As typical of mimic-model relationships, mimic surgeonfish were always less abundant than their model. Spatial variation in the abundance of mimics was correlated with models, while the abundance of adults was not. We show that juvenile surgeonfish gain a foraging advantage by mimicking the angelfish. Mimic surgeonfish were always found within 1-2 m of a similar-sized individual of C. vroliki with which they spent c. 10{\%} of their time in close association. When in association with angelfish, juvenile surgeonfish exhibited an increase of c. 10{\%} in the amount of time spent feeding compared to when they were alone. This foraging benefit seems to be explained by reduced aggression by the territorial damselfish Plectroglyphidon lacrymatus, which dominates the reef crest habitat. While adult A. pyroferus and all other surgeonfish were aggressively displaced from damselfish territories, mimic surgeonfish and their models were attacked less frequently and were not always displaced. Stomach contents analysis showed that the diet of C. vroliki differed substantially from P. lacrymatus, while that of A. pyroferus was more similar to the damselfish. We hypothesize that mimics deceive damselfish as to their diet in order to gain access to food supplies in defended areas.},

abstract = {1. Marine herbivorous fishes are considered to be of critical importance in determining the biological structure of shallow reef environments, and by implication have key roles in carbon flux in reef ecosystems. Despite this, the nutritional processes that underpin these critical ecological roles have received comparatively little attention. 2. Here we give an overview of recent progress in the nutritional ecology of marine herbivorous fishes, and then examine two recent paradigms that we consider important in the development of the field: (i) the role of temperature in latitudinal gradients of diversity and abundance, and (ii) the impact of these fishes on coral reefs. Our aim is to illustrate how an integrative nutritional ecology approach can enrich insights gained from studies of fish herbivory, and to emphasize the distinctive differences between herbivory in marine and terrestrial systems. 3. We argue that much of the work on trophic biology in marine herbivorous fishes has focused on the ecological impacts of fishes on reefs, the deterrent properties of marine algae, and the morphological and mechanical aspects of ingestion. This has come at the expense of two of the elements necessary for an integrative understanding of feeding ecology, that is, food composition and the physiological processes involved in nutrient extraction and utilization. Together, these factors have hindered the development of the nutritional framework for analysing food resources, feeding patterns and evolutionary trends that has proved successful for terrestrial vertebrate herbivores. 4. The reef grazing and algal secondary metabolite paradigms, while both extremely productive, have failed to develop the clear predictive framework for diet choice required in broader contexts such as reef management and understanding the evolution of herbivory. The lack of a focus on nutritional factors has led to premature conclusions on the influence of temperature on algal digestion, both at the level of digestive processes and the biogeography of marine faunas. 5. Some marine herbivorous fishes appear to be bending the 'rules' of hindgut fermentation, especially with respect to temperature and fermentation substrates, and so the study of nutritional ecology in these animals has potential to generate novel insights for the field of vertebrate nutrition in general. {\textcopyright} 2009 The Authors.},

abstract = {Phosphorus is undeniably an important element in the marine environment. Its role as a limiting macronutrient for primary productivity inextricably links it to the global carbon cycle and thus the climate system over geologic time scales. However, there remain many unanswered questions or ambiguous answers to the global phosphorus cycle. Pinpointing the sources and sinks of this globally importan element remain elusive, and changes of either one could greatly alter the residence time of P in the ocean and thus, estimates of its contribution to carbon export throught ocean productivity, Furthermore, athropegenic inputs of P to the marine environment are greatly altering the source contibution of P, and the ultimate effects of these additions and how they will interact with anthropogenic inputs of nitrogen and other elements and, more importnatly, how they will affect marine ecosystmes are still largely unknown. With the advent of new techniques, we have gained a greater understanding of the forms of phosphorus in the marine environment and how specific organisms utilize each of these phosphorus pools. Major advances have been made not only in identifying the microorganisms which are active in the turnover of organic phosphorus compounds but also in identifying the genes which are involved in creating the enzymes that make this turnover possible. Furthermore, specific species have been identified which can utilize specific enzymes to access forms of P that were previously thought to be too recalcitrant to be biologically available. However, the time scales and the quantity of P turnover in this manner remain undefined. Consequently, despite the advancement in both knowledge and techniques available to understand the marine phosphorus cycle, we still have a long way to go before the cycle can be fully characterized. However, with the increased realization that the marine P cycle is more dynamic than previously thought, it is likely that more studies will focus on this element in the future. {\textcopyright} 2007 American Chemical Society.},

Intraspecific coprophagy and autocoprophagy were very rare and most coprophagous interactions were between members of different trophic groups. Fecal material moved through a feeding network of fishes, from carnivores to herbivores with low carbonate diets (LCDs) of fleshy (principally red) microalgae to herbivores with LCDs of brown macroalgae to high carbonate diet (HCD) herbivores and detritivores. Intermediate links were often omitted. This network retained food material entering it and, because herbivores ate piscivore feces, appeared to recycle some food. Fishes ate almost all the feces of zooplanktivores and other carnivores, and most of the feces produced by herbivores with LCDs of microalgae and by coralivores with LCDs of hard-coral tissue.},

abstract = {Understanding species' roles in food webs requires an accurate assessment of their trophic niche. However, it is challenging to delineate potential trophic interactions across an ecosystem, and a paucity of empirical information often leads to inconsistent definitions of trophic guilds based on expert opinion, especially when applied to hyperdiverse ecosystems. Using coral reef fishes as a model group, we show that experts disagree on the assignment of broad trophic guilds for more than 20{\%} of species, which hampers comparability across studies. Here, we propose a quantitative, unbiased, and reproducible approach to define trophic guilds and apply recent advances in machine learning to predict probabilities of pairwise trophic interactions with high accuracy. We synthesize data from community-wide gut content analyses of tropical coral reef fishes worldwide, resulting in diet information from 13,961 individuals belonging to 615 reef fish. We then use network analysis to identify 8 trophic guilds and Bayesian phylogenetic modeling to show that trophic guilds can be predicted based on phylogeny and maximum body size. Finally, we use machine learning to test whether pairwise trophic interactions can be predicted with accuracy. Our models achieved a misclassification error of less than 5{\%}, indicating that our approach results in a quantitative and reproducible trophic categorization scheme, as well as high-resolution probabilities of trophic interactions. By applying our framework to the most diverse vertebrate consumer group, we show that it can be applied to other organismal groups to advance reproducibility in trait-based ecology. Our work thus provides a viable approach to account for the complexity of predator–prey interactions in highly diverse ecosystems.},

abstract = {Two species of benthic damselfishes from the Gulf of California, Mexico, use contrasting behaviors when feeding on benthic algal communities. The small (±70 g) Cortez damselfish, Eupomacentrus rectifraenum (Gill, 1862), feeds selectively from a multi-species algal mat, eats fleshy red and green algae and ignores brown and calcareous algae. The giant blue damselfish, Microspathodon dorsalis (Gill, 1862), is a large (±450 g), lethargic, nonselective feeder which grazes on a near monoculture of a fleshy red alga, Polysiphonia sp. Feeding activity for both species is low in the morning peaks during late afternoon, and drops sharply as night approaches. Based on feeding rates, gut-filling times, and weights of gut contents, Cortez damselfish process six to eight full guts of food and giant blue damselfish three full guts of food per day. The algal mat exhibits high standing crops (291-618 g dry wt {\textperiodcentered} m-2) and low productivity, but the preferred food of the Cortez damselfish (Ulva) appears to colonize the mat frequently and grow rapidly. The Polysiphonia dominated community on giant blue damselfish territories exhibits low standing crops (23 g {\textperiodcentered} m-2) and high productivity (34-47 times that of the mat per gram algae). Even though the feeding behaviors and resources used by the two damselfishes differ, both species eat similar food (delicate red and green fleshy algae, and depend on rapid colonization and/or high productivity to maintain their primary foods in the grazed algal community. {\textcopyright} 1980.},

abstract = {The past was a world of giants, with abundant whales in the sea and large animals roaming the land. However, that world came to an end following massive late-Quaternary megafauna extinctions on land and widespread population reductions in great whale populations over the past few centuries. These losses are likely to have had important consequences for broad-scale nutrient cycling, because recent literature suggests that large animals disproportionately drive nutrient movement. We estimate that the capacity of animals to move nutrients away from concentration patches has decreased to about 8{\%} of the preextinction value on land and about 5{\%} of historic values in oceans. For phosphorus (P), a key nutrient, upward movement in the ocean by marine mammals is about 23{\%} of its former capacity (previously about 340 million kg of P per year). Movements by seabirds and anadromous fish provide important transfer of nutrients from the sea to land, totalling ∼150 million kg of P per year globally in the past, a transfer that has declined to less than 4{\%} of this value as a result of the decimation of seabird colonies and anadromous fish populations. We propose that in the past, marine mammals, seabirds, anadromous fish, and terrestrial animals likely formed an interlinked system recycling nutrients from the ocean depths to the continental interiors, with marine mammals moving nutrients from the deep sea to surface waters, seabirds and anadromous fish moving nutrients from the ocean to land, and large animals moving nutrients away from hotspots into the continental interior.},

abstract = {Coral reefs support spectacularly productive and diverse communities in tropical and sub-tropical waters throughout the world's oceans. Debate continues, however, on the degree to which reef biomass is supported by new water column production, benthic primary production, and recycled detrital carbon (C). We coupled compound-specific stable C isotope ratio ($\delta$13C) analyses with Bayesian mixing models to quantify C flow from primary producers to coral reef fishes across multiple feeding guilds and trophic positions in the Red Sea. Analyses of reef fishes with putative diets composed primarily of zooplankton (Amblyglyphidodon indicus), benthic macroalgae (Stegastes nigricans), reef-associated detritus (Ctenochaetus striatus), and coral tissue (Chaetodon trifascialis) confirmed that $\delta$13C values of essential amino acids from all baseline C sources were both isotopically diagnostic and accurately recorded in consumer tissues. While all four source end-members contributed to the production of coral reef fishes in our study, a single-source end-member often dominated dietary C assimilation of a given species, even for highly mobile, generalist top predators. Microbially reworked detritus was an important secondary C source for most species. Seascape configuration played an important role in structuring resource utilization patterns. For instance, Lutjanus ehrenbergii showed a significant shift from a benthic macroalgal food web on shelf reefs (71 ± 13 {\%} of dietary C) to a phytoplankton-based food web (72 ± 11 {\%}) on oceanic reefs. Our work provides insights into the roles that diverse C sources play in the structure and function of coral reef ecosystems and illustrates a powerful fingerprinting method to develop and test nutritional frameworks for understanding resource utilization.},

abstract = {Anthropogenic stressors have strong impacts on ecosystems. To understand their influence, detailed knowledge about trophic relationships among species is critical. However, this requires both exceptional resolution in dietary assessments and sampling breadth within communities, especially for highly diverse, tropical ecosystems. We used gut content metabarcoding across a broad range of coral reef fishes (8 families, 22 species) in Mo'orea, French Polynesia, to test whether this technique has the potential to capture the structure of a hyperdiverse marine food web. Moreover, we explored whether taxonomic groups (families) and traditional, broad-scale trophic assignments explained fish diet across four different metrics of quantifying predator–prey interactions. Metabarcoding yielded a large number (4,341) of unique operational taxonomic units (i.e. prey) with high-resolution taxonomic assignments (i.e. often to the level of genus or species). We demonstrate that across multiple metrics, taxonomic group at the family level is a consistently better, albeit still weak, predictor of empirical trophic relationships than frequently used, broad-scale functional assignments. Our method also reveals a complex trophic network with fine-scale partitioning among species, further emphasizing the importance of examining fish diets beyond broad trophic categories. We demonstrate the capacity of metabarcoding to reconstruct diverse and complex food webs with exceptional resolution, a significant advancement from traditional food web reconstruction. Furthermore, this method allows us to pinpoint the trophic niche of species with niche-based modelling, even across hyperdiverse species assemblages such as coral reefs. In conjunction with complementary techniques such as stable isotope analysis, applying metabarcoding to whole communities will provide unparalleled information about energy and nutrient fluxes and inform their susceptibility to disturbances even in the world's most diverse ecosystems.},

Here, we propose to link the two fields of research on ES and BEF relationships and highlight a number of potential avenues for further research. First, we cast a stoichiometric view on drivers of biodiversity change. Second, we address the stoichiometric underpinning of biodiversity-productivity relationships.

abstract = {Animal communities are essential drivers of energy and elemental flow in ecosystems. However, few studies have investigated the functional role of animals as sources of dissolved organic matter (DOM) and the subsequent utilization of that DOM by the microbial community. In a small forested headwater stream, we tested the effects of taxonomy, feeding traits, and body size on the quality and quantity of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) excreted by aquatic insects. In addition, we conducted steady-state solute additions to estimate instream demand for labile C and compared it to the C excreted by invertebrates. Individual excretion rates and excretion composition varied with body size, taxonomy and feeding guild. The estimated average community excretion rate was 1.31 $\mu$g DOC{\textperiodcentered} per mg insect dry weight (DW) −1 hr −1 and 0.33 $\mu$g DON{\textperiodcentered}mg DW −1 hr -1 , and individuals excreted DON at nearly twice the rate of NH +4 . This DOM was 2–5 times more bioavailable to microbial heterotrophs than ambient stream water DOM. We estimated that the insect community, conservatively, excreted 1.62 mg of bioavailable DOC{\textperiodcentered}m −2 hr −1 and through steady-state additions measured an ambient labile C demand as 3.97 ± 0.67 mg C m −2 hr −1 . This suggests that insect-mediated transformation and excretion of labile DOC could satisfy a significant fraction (40 ± 7{\%}) of labile C demand in this small stream. Collectively, our results suggest that animal excretion plays an essential functional role in transforming organic matter into microbially bioavailable forms and may satisfy a variable but significant portion of microbial demand for labile C and N.

abstract = {Failure to provision tissues with an appropriate balance of nutrients engenders fitness costs. Maintaining nutrient balance can be achieved by adjusting the selection and consumption of foods, but this may not be possible when the nutritional environment is limiting. Under such circumstances, rebalancing of an imbalanced nutrient intake requires post-ingestive mechanisms. The first stage at which such postingestive rebalancing might occur is within the gastrointestinal tract (GIT), by differential release of digestive enzymes-releasing less of those enzymes for nutrients present in excess while maintaining or boosting levels of enzymes for nutrients in deficit. Here, we use an insect herbivore, the locust, to show for the first time that such compensatory responses occur within the GIT. Furthermore, we show that differential release of proteases and carbohydrases in response to nutritional state translate into differential extraction of macronutrients from host plants. The prevailing view is that physiological and structural plasticity in the GIT serves to maximize the rate of nutrient gain in relation to costs of maintaining the GIT; our findings show that GIT plasticity is integral to the maintenance of nutrient balance. {\textcopyright} 2010 The Royal Society.},

@article{Sitters2017,
abstract = {It is widely recognized that the release of nutrients by herbivores via their waste products strongly impacts nutrient availability for autotrophs. The ratios of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) recycled through herbivore release (i.e., waste N:P) are mainly determined by the stoichiometric composition of the herbivore's food (food N:P) and its body nutrient content (body N:P). Waste N:P can in turn impact autotroph nutrient limitation and productivity. Herbivore-driven nutrient recycling based on stoichiometric principles is dominated by theoretical and experimental research in freshwater systems, in particular interactions between algae and invertebrate herbivores. In terrestrial ecosystems, the impact of herbivores on nutrient cycling and availability is often limited to studying carbon (C):N and C:P ratios, while the role of terrestrial herbivores in mediating N:P ratios is also likely to influence herbivore-driven nutrient recycling. In this review, we use rules and predictions on the stoichiometry of nutrient release originating from algal-based aquatic systems to identify the factors that determine the stoichiometry of nutrient release by herbivores. We then explore how these rules can be used to understand the stoichiometry of nutrient release by terrestrial herbivores, ranging from invertebrates to mammals, and its impact on plant nutrient limitation and productivity. Future studies should focus on measuring both N and P when investigating herbivore-driven nutrient recycling in terrestrial ecosystems, while also taking the form of waste product (urine or feces) and other pathways by which herbivores change nutrients into account, to be able to quantify the impact of waste stoichiometry on plant communities.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT: We quantified release rates of carbon (C), nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) waste from Norwegian salmon farms in 2009 in order to evaluate the theoretical environmental influence on surrounding waters and the potential for integrated multi-trophic aquaculture (IMTA) driven by salmon aquaculture. Of the total feed input, 70{\%} C, 62{\%} N and 70{\%} P were released into the environment, equivalent to an annual discharge of about 404000, 50600 and 9400 t of C, N and P, respectively, based on total salmon production of 1.02 × 106 t. We predicted that 48{\%} of feed C was respired as CO2, 45{\%} of feed N was excreted as dissolved inorganic N (DIN), and 18{\%} of feed P was excreted as dissolved inorganic P (DIP). Approximately 44{\%} of feed P was released as particles, dominating solid wastes. The mean food conversion ratio (feed supplied per fish produced) of Norwegian salmon farms was 1.16 ± 0.08 SE in 2009. Estimates of the potential for IMTA driven by salmon farming showed a far higher potential for seaweed production based on the released DIN than for mussel production based on released appropriately sized particulate organic carbon (POC). The daily volumetric loading rates of DIN from salmon farms (range for counties: 40 to 501 µg N m−3 d−1) were {\textless}15{\%} of the natural loading rate of nitrate from deep water, suggesting that the nutrient loading rate is within safe limits.},

abstract = {Animal defecation, or egestion, is a pronounced transformation of organic matter in many ecosystems. However, because egesta have been presumed recalcitrant and low nutrient, their significance and variability as an animal nutrient flux in aquatic settings – especially relative to mineralization via excretion – are poorly known. We compared carbon (C), nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) dynamics over short- to long-term (up to 107 days) microbial decomposition of egesta from the aquatic shredders Allocapnia spp., Lirceus spp. and Tipula spp. fed low- or high-P content Platanus occidentalis litter to investigate roles of egesta in aquatic nutrient dynamics. Tipula produced N and P deplete egesta of higher N : P compared to Lirceus and Allocapnia, and high-P diets increased egesta P content compared to low-P diets. Despite measurable C losses to decomposition, these differences in nutrient content persisted through decomposition, showing diet and species control both immediate and long-term properties of egested particles. Egesta switched between uptake and release of dissolved phosphorus and ammonium during decomposition, and exhibited consistent net N uptake as nitrate–nitrite. Across species and diets, lower N : P egesta tended to exhibit greater uptake of dissolved inorganic N, suggesting P enrichment of egesta drove stronger dissolved N demand by decomposer microbes. Shredder egesta exhibit stable nutrient contents long term and, counter to assumptions that they are negligible or minor net sources, can be strong, extended sinks of dissolved inorganic nutrients. Future studies should consider contrasts between animal nutrient fluxes as excretion, which facilitates nutrient recycling via mineralization, vs. egestion, which slows nutrient recycling via organic nutrient repackaging and can create sinks of dissolved nutrients.

abstract = {Relationships among food choice, compensatory feeding, and the consequences for consumer fitness rarely have been quantified. We created foods of varying nutritional quality and evaluated the consequences of compensatory feeding for three sympatric species of amphipods by analyzing food choices, feeding rates, and long-term effects on fitness. Nutritional quality was manipulated by creating low-quality diets from algae (low in protein, nitrogen, and total organic carbon), high-quality diets from commercial fish food (high in protein, nitrogen, and total organic carbon), and intermediate-quality diets from mixtures of those two foods. When high- and low-quality diets were simultaneously offered, the more mobile, non-tube-building amphipods, Gammarus mucronatus and Elasmopus levis, both fed preferentially on the high-quality diet. The more sedentary, tube-building amphipod Ampithoe longimana did not discriminate between these foods. When confined to a single food type, all three species exhibited compensatory feeding on the low-quality diet. Despite compensatory feeding, when Elasmopus levis were cultured on the low-quality food, they experienced reduced survivorship, growth, and fecundity during two successive ovulations, compared to individuals feeding on more nutrient-rich foods. Low-nutrient foods caused similar declines in growth and female gonad size for Gammarus mucronatus. In contrast, the survivorship, growth, and fecundity of Ampithoe longimana was not affected by any of the diets tested. Thus, compensatory feeding allowed the more sedentary species, Ampithoe longimana, to completely circumvent the effects of low nutritional quality, but the same behavior was ineffective for both of the more mobile species, Gammarus mucronatus and Elasmopus levis. The ability of A. longimana to achieve equal fitness by substituting food quantity for food quality may allow this sedentary species to form longer associations with individual host plants, minimize movement among hosts, and thus lower its risk of being detected by predators.},

Our multi-scale approach included sampling at 11 sites spanning the entire range of the species from the western Indian Ocean to the eastern Pacific, across 240° of longitude (total N = 278), and 9 islands throughout one of the largest and most isolated archipelagos, the Hawaiian Islands (subtotal N = 147). Analysis of cytochrome b sequences demonstrated the following: (1) common haplotypes are shared among all sample localities, (2) there is modest population structure across the entire species range ($\Phi$st = 0.211; p {\textless} 0.001), (3) there is no structure among the Hawaiian Islands ($\Phi$st = 0.0004; p = 0.4107), and (4) there is no structure across the central-west Pacific ($\Phi$st = -0.007, p = 0.634). Population separations across the East Pacific Barrier were significant (overall $\Phi$st = 0.278, p {\textless} 0.001; pairwise range $\Phi$st, = 0.107 to 0.424), yet significantly weaker than those across the Indo-Pacific Barrier (overall $\Phi$st = 0.583, p {\textless} 0.001; pairwise range $\Phi$st = 0.329 to 0.810; Mann-Whitney U-test, p {\textless} 0.001). When grouped by major biogeographic province, populations showed no difference within the central-west Pacific ($\Phi$st = -0.007, p = 0.634), within the Indian Ocean ($\Phi$st = -0.027, p = 0.528), or within the east Pacific ($\Phi$st = -0.061, p = 0.920). Mismatch distributions and coalescence analysis indicated a rapid population expansion on the order of -500 000 yr before present (range 300 000 to 106 yr depending on mutation rate). Despite having a vast distribution and broad depth range, M. berndti shows the genetic signatures of a population bottleneck and recovery similar to shallow reef specialists that were displaced or extirpated during glacial maxima. Overall, the mtDNA data indicated a dispersal capability in M. berndti which far exceeds that of typical reef fishes. While recent genetic studies demonstrate limited larval dispersal in some reef fishes, it is clear that others, including soldierfishes, are extensive dispersers. {\textcopyright} Inter-Research 2007.},

abstract = {We quantified the nitrogen and enzyme hydrolyzable amino acid (EHAA) concentrations of sediments prior to and after corals sloughed, ingested, and egested sediments layered onto their surfaces, for the three coral species Siderastrea siderea, Agaricia agaricites, and Porites astreoides in Jamaica. The percent nitrogen of the sediments egested by all three species was lower than in the sediments available to the corals. Additionally, the sediments sloughed (not ingested) by A. agaricites and P. astreoides were lower in percent nitrogen, while the sediments sloughed by S. siderea had the same percent nitrogen as that of the available sediments. The percent nitrogen of the sediments sloughed and egested by P. astreoides showed significant negative and positive relationships, respectively, to increasing sediment loads, while the percent nitrogen of the sediments sloughed and egested by both S. siderea and A. agaricites showed no relationship to sediment load. EHAA concentrations were not significantly different between the sloughed and available sediments but were significantly lower in the sediments egested by S. siderea and A. agaricites (EHAA concentrations were not measured for P. astreodies sediment fractions). Comparisons of the nitrogen and EHAA concentrations in the sloughed and egested sediments to what was available prior to coral processing show that maximum ingestion was between 0.1 and 0.2 µg N µg−1 coral N cm−2 and between 0.5 and 0.6 µg EHAA{\textperiodcentered}cm−2. Maximum assimilation efficiencies were estimated to be 30–60{\%} of the available nitrogen. The data show that corals ingest and alter the nitrogen concentration of particles that land on their surfaces. The corals' abilities to process these sediments, and the sediments' possible contributions to coral nutrition, are discussed based on these results.},

abstract = {Animal-derived nutrients play an important role in structuring nutrient regimes within and between ecosystems. When animals undergo repetitive, aggregating behavior through time, they can create nutrient hotspots where rates of biogeochemical activity are higher than those found in the surrounding environment. In turn, these hotspots can influence ecosystem processes and community structure. We examined the potential for reef fishes from the family Haemulidae (grunts) to create nutrient hotspots and the potential impact of these hotspots on reef communities. To do so, we tracked the schooling locations of diurnally migrating grunts, which shelter at reef sites during the day but forage off reef each night, and measured the impact of these fish schools on benthic communities. We found that grunt schools showed a high degree of site fidelity, repeatedly returning to the same coral heads. These aggregations created nutrient hotspots around coral heads where nitrogen and phosphorus delivery was roughly 10 and 7 times the respective rates of delivery to structurally similar sites that lacked schools of these fishes. In turn, grazing rates of herbivorous fishes at grunt-derived hotspots were approximately 3 times those of sites where grunts were rare. These differences in nutrient delivery and grazing led to distinct benthic communities with higher cover of crustose coralline algae and less total algal abundance at grunt aggregation sites. Importantly, coral growth was roughly 1.5 times greater at grunt hotspots, likely due to the important nutrient subsidy. Our results suggest that schooling reef fish and their nutrient subsidies play an important role in mediating community structure on coral reefs and that overfishing may have important negative consequences on ecosystem functions. As such, management strategies must consider mesopredatory fishes in addition to current protection often offered to herbivores and top-tier predators. Furthermore, our results suggest that restoration strategies may benefit from focusing on providing structure for aggregating fishes on reefs with low topographic complexity or focusing the restoration of nursery raised corals around existing nutrient hotspots.},

C. chromis are more efficient at absorbing nutrients from their diet than herbivorous Pomacentridae, and excrete more faeces in the spring when their plankton food is more abundant. Faeces released in the water column sink rapidly to the substratum and are consumed by herbivorous and omnivorous fish. Faeces released into night-shelters are rapidly consumed by invertebrate detritivores, and particularly mobile scavengers, such as shrimps and hermit crabs. Night-time accrual of Chromis faeces represents a very important flux of N and P.

Our results for trout, cod, largemouth bass, and striped bass support the third but not the first or second of Aristotle's theories. In all four species, the caeca prove to be a major site of sugar, amino acid, and dipeptide uptake, contributing more uptake than the entire remaining alimentary tract in trout and cod. Caecal brush-border membranes contain hydrolytic enzymes. X-ray plates taken at various times after trout had ingested radioopaque marker, and observations of trout fed blue dye plus glass beads of graded sizes, show that caeca fill and empty of food with the same time course as proximal intestine. Thus, whereas the caeca of mammals and birds serve as fermentation chambers, fish caeca are an adaptation to increase gut surface area.},

Here we show that these interaction strengths are structured nonrandomly in a large Caribbean marine food web. Specifically, the cooccurrence of strong interactions on two consecutive levels of food chains occurs less frequently than expected by chance. Even when they occur, these strongly interacting chains are accompanied by strong omnivory more often than expected by chance. By using a food web model, we show that these interaction strength combinations reduce the likelihood of trophic cascades after the overfishing of top predators. However, fishing selectively removes predators that are overrepresented in strongly interacting chains. Hence, the potential for strong community-wide effects remains a threat. {\textcopyright} 2005 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.},

However, all differences in whole fish C, N, and P chemistry were small. Cyprinids had the following mean composition: carbon, 46{\%}; nitrogen, 9.7{\%}; and phosphorus, 1.5{\%}. The cyprinid molar C:N:P ratio was 242:16:1. These values make cyprinids relatively low in phosphorus compared to other fish that have been previously studied, especially members of the Percidae and Centrarchidae. Gut contents were lower in N and P than the whole fish, and C:N and C:P ratios were correspondingly higher in gut contents than in the whole fish. Thus, minnows must concentrate both of these nutrients within their biomass compared to what they eat. The N:P ratio of minnows and minnow gut contents had nearly identical means. All chemical variables showed lower variation in the fish than in the gut contents, supporting a home-ostatic model of nutrient flux. Stable nitrogen isotope analysis found that minnows were 3‰ (parts per thousand) heavier than their gut contents, providing evidence that gut contents analyzed were derived mainly from ingested material. A homeostatic nutrient model appears to be an appropriate one for fish.},

We examined gut length in 28 species of butterflyfishes (Chaetodontidae), which encompass a wide range of dietary types (planktivores, omnivores, and corallivores). We found general dietary patterns to be a good predictor of relative gut length, although we found high variation among groups and covariance with body size. The longest gut lengths are found in species that exclusively feed on the living tissue of corals, while the shortest gut length is found in a planktivorous species. Although we tried to control for phylogeny, corallivory has arisen multiple times in this family, confounding our analyses. The butterflyfishes, a speciose family with a wide range of dietary habits, may nonetheless provide an ideal system for future work studying gut physiology associated with specialization and foraging behaviors. {\textcopyright} 2011 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract = {Patterns of ecological specialization offer invaluable information about ecosystems. Yet, specialization is rarely quantified across several ecological niche axes and variables beyond the link between morphological and dietary specialization have received little attention. Here, we provide a quantitative evaluation of ecological specialization in a coral reef fish assemblage (f. Acanthuridae) along one fundamental and two realized niche axes. Specifically, we examined ecological specialization in 10 surgeonfish species with regards to morphology and two realized niche axes associated with diet and foraging microhabitat utilization using a recently developed multidimensional framework. We then investigated the potential relationships between morphological and behavioural specialization. These relationships differed markedly from the traditional ecomorphological paradigm. While morphological specialization showed no relationship with dietary specialization, it exhibited a strong relationship with foraging microhabitat specialization. However, this relationship was inverted: species with specialized morphologies were microhabitat generalists, whereas generalized morphotypes were microhabitat specialists. Interestingly, this mirrors relationships found in plant–pollinator communities and may also be applicable to other ecosystems, highlighting the potential importance of including niche axes beyond dietary specialization into ecomorphological frameworks. On coral reefs, it appears that morphotypes commonly perceived as most generalized may, in fact, be specialized in exploiting flat and easily accessible microhabitats.},

abstract = {The use of nitrogen-to-protein conversion factors (N-Prot factors) is the most practical way of determining protein content. The accuracy of protein determination by this method depends on the establishment of N-Prot factors specific to individual species. Experimental data are needed to allow the use of this methodology with seaweeds. The present study was designed to characterize the amino acid composition and to establish specific N-Prot factors for six green, four brown and nine red marine algae. Mean values for individual amino acids tended to be similar among the three groups, but some differences were found. Green algae tended to show lower percentages of both aspartic acid and glutamic acid than the other two groups of algae. The percentages of both lysine and arginine were higher in red algae, while brown algae tended to show more methionine than green and red algae. The actual protein content of the species, based on the sum of amino acid residues, varied from 10.8{\%} (Chnoospora minima, brown algae) to 23.1{\%} (Aglaothamnion uruguayense, red algae) of the dry weight. Nitrogen-to-protein conversion factors were established for the species studied, based on the ratio of amino acid residues to total nitrogen, with values ranging from 3.75 (Cryptonemia seminervis, red algae) to 5.72 (Padina gymnospora, brown algae). The relative importance of non-protein nitrogen is greater in red algae, and consequently lower N-Prot factors were calculated for these species (average value 4.59). Conversely, protein nitrogen content in both green and brown algae tends to be higher, and average N-Prot factors were 5.13 and 5.38, respectively. An overall average N-Prot factor for all species studied of 4.92 ± 0.59 (n = 57) was established. This study confirms that the use of the traditional factor 6.25 is unsuitable for seaweeds, and the use of the N. Prot factors proposed here is recommended.},

abstract = {The impact of marine animals on the iron (Fe) cycle has mostly been considered in terms of their role in supplying dissolved Fe to phytoplankton at the ocean surface. However, little attention has been paid to how the transformation of ingested food into fecal matter by animals alters the relative Fe-richness of particles, which could have consequences for Fe cycling in the water column and for the food quality of suspended and sinking particles. Here, we compile observations to show that the Fe to carbon (C) ratio (Fe:C) of fecal pellets of various marine animals is consistently enriched compared to their food, often by more than an order of magnitude. We explain this consistent enrichment by the low assimilation rates that have been measured for Fe in animals, together with the respiratory conversion of dietary organic C to excreted dissolved inorganic C. Furthermore, we calculate that this enrichment should cause animal fecal matter to constitute a major fraction of the global sinking flux of biogenic Fe, a component of the marine iron cycle that has been previously unappreciated. We also estimate that this fecal iron pump provides an important source of Fe to marine animals via coprophagy, particularly in the mesopelagic, given that fecal matter Fe:C can be many-fold higher than the Fe:C of local phytoplankton. Our results imply that the fecal iron pump is important both for global Fe cycling and for the iron nutrition of pelagic and mesopelagic communities.},

From over 100 values reported for about 50 fish species, it has been observed that nitrogen content of food holds a positive correlation to absorption efficiency; the relation is significantly (P {\textless} 0.001) correlated (r= {\textgreater} 0.9).

However, the comparative role of egestion as an animal-mediated nutrient flux remains understudied. We conducted a literature survey and meta-analysis to directly compare nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and N:P of egestion compared to excretion rates and ratios across freshwater animals. Synthesizing 215 datasets across 47 animal species (all primary consumers or omnivores), we show that the total N and P egestion rates exceed inorganic N and P excretion rates but not total N and P excretion rates, and that proportions of P egested compared to excreted depend on body size and animal phylum. We further show that variance of egestion rates is often greater than excretion rates, reflecting greater inter-individual and temporal variation of egestion as a nutrient flux in comparison to excretion. At phylogenetic levels, our analysis suggests that Mollusca exhibit the greatest rates and variance of P egestion relative to excretion, especially compared to Arthropoda. Given quantitative evidence of egestion as a dominant and dynamic animal-mediated nutrient flux, our synthesis demonstrates the need for additional studies of rates, stoichiometry, and roles of animal egestion in aquatic settings.},

Bacteria cell abundances, as determined via epifluorescence microscopy, ranged two orders of magnitude among the fishes. Mass-specific and apparent cell-specific hydrolytic enzyme activities in feces from Chlorurus sordidus were very high, suggesting that endogenous fish enzymes were egested into feces. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis profiles of 16S rRNA genes were more similar among multiple individuals of the surgeonfish Acanthurus nigricans than among individuals of the parrotfish C. sordidus or the snapper Lutjanus bohar. Analyses of feces-derived 16S rRNA gene clones revealed that at least five bacterial phyla were present in A. nigricans and that Vibrionaceae comprised 10{\%} of the clones. Meanwhile, C. sordidus contained at least five phyla and L. bohar three, but Vibrionaceae comprised 71{\%} and 76{\%} of the clones, respectively. Many sequences clustered phylogenetically to cultured Vibrio spp. and Photobacterium spp. including Vibrio ponticus and Photobacterium damselae. Other Vibrionaceae-like sequences comprised a distinct phylogenetic group that may represent the presence of 'feces-specific' bacteria.

abstract = {Increasing dietary specialization is an inherently risky strategy because it increases a species' vulnerability to resource depletion. However, risks associated with dietary specialization may be offset by increased performance when feeding on preferred prey. Although rarely demonstrated, highly specialized species are expected to outperform generalists when feeding on their preferred prey, whereas generalists are predicted to have more similar performance across a range of different prey. To test this theory, we compared the growth rates of two obligate coral-feeding butterflyfishes (Chaetodon trifascialis and Chaetodon plebeius) maintained on exclusive diets of preferred vs nonpreferred prey. In the field, C. trifascialis was the most specialized species, feeding almost exclusively on just one coral species, Acropora hyacinthus. C. plebeius meanwhile, was much less specialized, but fed predominantly on Pocillopora damicornis. During growth experiments, C. trifascialis grew fastest when feeding on A. hyacinthus and did not grow at all when feeding on less preferred prey (P. damicornis and Porites cylindrica). C. plebeius performed equally well on both A. hyacinthus and P. damicornis (its preferred prey), but performed poorly when feeding on P. cylindrica. Both butterflyfishes select coral species that maximize juvenile growth, but contrary to expectations, the more specialized species (C. trifascialis) did not outperform the generalist species (C. plebeius) when both consumed their preferred prey. Increased dietary specialization, therefore, appears to be a questionable strategy, as there was no evidence of any increased benefits to offset increases in susceptibility to disturbance. {\textcopyright} 2007 Springer-Verlag.},

Although there is evidence that coral reefs thrive under certain conditions (eg moderate water temperatures, limited fishing pressure), the dynamic processes that promote ecosystem functioning and its internal drivers (ie community structure) are poorly defined and explored. Specifically, despite decades of research suggesting a positive relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning across biomes, few studies have explored this relationship in coral reef systems. We propose a practical definition of coral reef functioning, centered on eight complementary ecological processes: calcium carbonate production and bioerosion, primary production and herbivory, secondary production and predation, and nutrient uptake and release. Connecting research on species niches, functional diversity of communities, and rates of the eight key processes can provide a novel, quantitative understanding of reef functioning and its dependence on coral reef communities that will chart the transition of coral reefs in the Anthropocene. This will contribute urgently needed guidance for the management of these important ecosystems.},

Penalized maximum likelihood estimates are calculated using optimization methods such as the limited memory Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno algorithm. Stan is also a platform for computing log densities and their gradients and Hessians, which can be used in alternative algorithms such as variational Bayes, expectation propagation, and marginal inference using approximate integration. To this end, Stan is set up so that the densities, gradients, and Hessians, along with intermediate quantities of the algorithm such as acceptance probabilities, are easily accessible. Stan can be called from the command line using the cmdstan package, through R using the rstan package, and through Python using the pystan package. All three interfaces support sampling and optimization-based inference with diagnostics and posterior analysis. rstan and pystan also provide access to log probabilities, gradients, Hessians, parameter transforms, and specialized plotting.},

Phos-phorus flux to inshore reefs via defecation of fecal pellets by the blacksmith C. punctipinnus in nocturnal shelters was comparable to estimates of phosphorus transport through surface waters by sinking zooplankton feces. Resistance of fecal pellets to degradation during long-term in d t u incuba-tion in nocturnal shelters suggests that bacteria do not play a significant role in controlling accumula-tion of fish feces on the reef.},

abstract = {Wilderness areas have been widely discussed in the terrestrial conservation literature, whereas the concept of marine wilderness has received scant attention. The recent move to protect very large areas of the ocean and thus preserve some of the final marine wilderness areas is a bold policy initiative. However, some important questions have remained unanswered, such as whether marine wilderness areas support a different composition and abundance of species than do the smaller marine no-take areas (NTAs) that are steadily dotting our coastlines. We present a case study from the world's largest wilderness coral reef NTA, the Chagos Archipelago, and demonstrate that fish biomass is six times greater than and composition substantially different from even the oldest NTAs in eight other Indian Ocean countries' waters. Clearly, marine wilderness does promote a unique ecological community, which smaller NTAs fail to attain, and formal legislation is therefore crucial to protect these last marine wilderness areas.

abstract = {The distribution of biomass among trophic levels provides a theoretical basis for understanding energy flow and the hierarchical structure of animal communities. In the absence of energy subsidies [1], bottom-heavy trophic pyramids are expected to predominate, based on energy transfer efficiency [2] and empirical evidence from multiple ecosystems [3]. However, the predicted pyramid of biomass distribution among trophic levels may be disrupted through trophic replacement by alternative organisms in the ecosystem, trophic cascades, and humans preferentially impacting specific trophic levels [4???6]. Using empirical data spanning {\textgreater}250 coral reefs, we show how trophic pyramid shape varies given human-mediated gradients along two orders of magnitude in reef fish biomass. Mean trophic level of the assemblage increased modestly with decreasing biomass, contrary to predictions of fishing down the food web [7]. The mean trophic level pattern is explained by trophic replacement of herbivorous fish by sea urchins at low biomass and the accumulation of??slow-growing, large-bodied, herbivorous fish at high biomass. Further, at high biomass, particularly where fishers are not selectively removing higher trophic level individuals, a concave trophic distribution emerges. The concave trophic distribution implies a??more direct link between lower and upper trophic levels, which may confer greater energy efficiency. This trophic distribution emerges when community biomass exceeds ???650??kg/ha, suggesting that fisheries for upper trophic level species will only be supported under lightly fished scenarios.},

abstract = {Intestinal tracts are among the most densely populated microbial ecosystems. Gut microbiota and their influence on the host have been well characterized in terrestrial vertebrates but much less so in fish. This is especially true for coral reef fishes, which are among the most abundant groups of vertebrates on earth. Surgeonfishes (family: Acanthuridae) are part of a large and diverse family of reef fish that display a wide range of feeding behaviours, which in turn has a strong impact on the reef ecology. Here, we studied the composition of the gut microbiota of nine surgeonfish and three nonsurgeonfish species from the Red Sea. High-throughput pyrosequencing results showed that members of the phylum Firmicutes, especially of the genus Epulopiscium, were dominant in the gut microbiota of seven surgeonfishes. Even so, there were large inter- and intraspecies differences in the diversity of surgeonfish microbiota. Replicates of the same host species shared only a small number of operational taxonomic units (OTUs), although these accounted for most of the sequences. There was a statistically significant correlation between the phylogeny of the host and their gut microbiota, but the two were not completely congruent. Notably, the gut microbiota of three nonsurgeonfish species clustered with some surgeonfish species. The microbiota of the macro- and microalgavores was distinct, while the microbiota of the others (carnivores, omnivores and detritivores) seemed to be transient and dynamic. Despite some anomalies, both host phylogeny and diet were important drivers for the intestinal microbial community structure of surgeonfishes from the Red Sea.},

   abstract = {Human impact increasingly alters global ecosystems, often reducing biodiversity and disrupting the provision of essential ecosystem services to humanity. Therefore, preserving ecosystem functioning is a critical challenge of the twenty-first century. Coral reefs are declining worldwide due to the pervasive effects of climate change and intensive fishing, and although research on coral reef ecosystem functioning has gained momentum, most studies rely on simplified proxies, such as fish biomass. This lack of quantitative assessments of multiple process-based ecosystem functions hinders local and regional conservation efforts. Here we combine global coral reef fish community surveys and bioenergetic models to quantify five key ecosystem functions mediated by coral reef fishes. We show that functions exhibit critical trade-offs driven by varying community structures, such that no community can maximize all functions. Furthermore, functions are locally dominated by few species, but the identity of dominant species substantially varies at the global scale. In fact, half of the 1,110 species in our dataset are functionally dominant in at least one location. Our results reinforce the need for a nuanced, locally tailored approach to coral reef conservation that considers multiple ecological functions beyond the effect of standing stock biomass. Integrating bioenergetic models and global coral reef fish community surveys, the authors show that there are functional trade-offs, meaning that no community can maximize all functions, and that dominant species underpin local functions, but their identity varies geographically.},
