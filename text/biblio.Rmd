nitrogen content explains absorption efficiency

herbivorous territorial reef-dwelling jewel damselfish Plectroglyphidodon lacrymatus (Quoy et Gaimard) was measured at Motupore Island, Papuan Coastal Lagoon, southern Papua New Guinea

Dietary absorption by the fish was high: 91.7% for N (76.5% in summer), 78.4% for C (58.3% in summer), and 61.4% for P (only summer data available). Organics were absorbed in the first 25% of the gut length. P. lacrymatus ingested 15% of its body N, 24% of C, and 37% of total material daily by mass.
