# The trophic role of fish feces in coral reefs

## Main message
1) Assimilation efficiency is generally very low. Therefore, the trophic role of fish poo is huge.
2) Food quality positively affects assimilation efficiency
3) Poo quality predicts coprophagy
4) Herbivores potentially eat a lot of poo

## Introduction

* Consumers play an essential role in ecosystem functioning through the recycling of nutrients and energy.
There are two main forms in which nutrient recycling takes place: inorganic nutrients, and fecal matter.    
* Assimilation efficiency represents the proportion of the ingested material that is assimilated by the organism. Non-assimilated food is excreted as fecal matter. Therefore, assimilation efficiency is a crucial parameter.       
* Relationship between assimilation efficiency and diet quality.    
* Assimilation efficiency and fishes. Fishes play an important role in the flux of energy and elements.
In mass balance models, AE is kept constant for all fishes even though we know that diet affects AE. Further, in trophic models such as ecopath, assimilation efficiency is not incorporated explicitely. Still, there are some indications that fish feces actually play a very important role in the food web. See examples of Robertson, invertebrates feeding on planktivore poo in crevices in Medsea and California.
* Coral reefs flourish in nutrient-poor conditions, and nutrients are recycled efficiently. Important role of fish pee and poo.
In recent years, the importance of fish excretion has been recognised and estimated (Burkepile, Allgeier &co). In 80ies Robertson sheds light on the prevalence of coprophagy, hinting on the important trophic role of fish feces. Information on assimilation efficiency in coral reefs is lacking. To fully grasp the role of fishes in nutrient cycling, we need to quanitify this parameter.

* Here, we quantify the assimilation efficiency for 51 coral reef fish species in Moorea, French Polynesia. Further, we explore the relationship with diet. Furthermore, we link our data with literature data on coprophagy to predict the probability for a fish to be a coprophage, and the probability of fish feces to be eaten. Finally, integrate bioenergetically modeled egestion rates with underwater visual census data of French polynesia to estimate the potential trophic role of fish feces.     


## Methods  

### Fish collection and dissection
All fishes were collected in Moorea, French polynesia across xx sites in the lagoon, outer reef and reef passes.   
Common species were targeted, resulting in a selection of 51 species from 15 fish families: Cirrhitidae, Zanclidae, Balistidae, Holocentridae, Chaetodontidae, Acanthuridae, Labridae, Aulostomidae, Mullidae, Serranidae, Pomacentridae, Pomacanthidae, Lethrinidae, Tetraodontidae, and  Monacanthidae. In total, we collected 625 individuals. All fishes were collected using spear fishing between 10am and 1pm. Fishes were pitted immidiately upon capture and transported to the laboratory in a cooler filled with ice. In the laboratory, fishes were measured, weighted, and samples were taken from the stomach content and posterior end of the gut. For fishes that do not contain a stomach (e.g. Labridae), a sample from the anterior part of the gut was taken instead. In some cases the anterior or posterior end of the gut was empty, in which case we did not collect a sample. On average, we took 8 and 10 samples of anterior and posteriar parts of the gut respectively. We took a minimum of 3 samples per species for both the anterior and posterior part of the gut.


### Sample processing and nutrient analysis    
Samples were frozen for at least 24 hours, and then dry-frozen for transport.
In Perpignan, samples were grounded to a fine powder and then sent to Michigan for elemental analysis.
more to add... Ask Tim? Should we include him as an author or just ask to provide detailed description?    

### Assimilation efficiency  
Because diet and fecal samples were taken at the same time, we could not assume that the diet items in the stomach are the same as the digested material in the feces. Therefore, we considered them as independent samples. We constructed a Bayesian model to quantify the assimilation efficiency on the species level as follows:

$$x_{1i} \sim normal(mu_{1i}, sigma_{1i}),$$
$$x_{2i} \sim normal(mu_{2i}, sigma_{2i}),$$
$$mu_{2i} = (1 - a_i) mu_{1i},$$

where $i$ is the element, $x_{1i}$ and $x_{2i}$ are measures of the elemental content of the stomach and the end of the gut respectively, and $a_i$ is the assimilation efficiency.   

### coprophagy
We digitalised the information provided in Robertson's paper. Per species, we noted the number of defaecation events observed as well as the number of feces observed being eaten by another fish species. Further, we compiled a table indicating whether or not a species was classified as a coprophage. We combined this information with our species-level estimates of diet and feces nutrient content, resulting in a selection of 14 species.  
We then predicted the probability of feces being eaten with the nutrient content of feces. Further, we predicted the probability of being a coprophage with the nutrient content of the stomach content.

Trophic guilds:    
1) Sessile invertivores: species predominantly feeding on Asteroidea, Bryozoa, Cirripedia, Porifera,and Tunicata    
2) Herbivores, microvores,and detritivores (HMD): species primarily feeding on autotrophs, detritus, inorganic material, foraminifera,and phytoplankton    
3) Corallivores: species primarily feeding on Anthozoa and Hydrozoa    
4) Piscivores: species primarily feeding on Actinopterygii and Cephalopoda    
5) Microinvertivores: species primarily feeding on Annelida, Arachnida, Hemichordata, Nematoda, Peracarida,and Nemertea   
6) Macroinvertivores: species primarily feeding on Mollusca and Echinodermata     
7) Crustacivores: species primarily feeding on Decapoda and Stomatopoda     
8) Planktivores: species mainly feeding on zooplankton and Harpacticoida    

maybe groups:
1) HMD (2)
2) Carnivores (4 + 7)
3) Mixed Invertivores (1, 3, 5, 6)
4) Planktivores (8)

### Figure 3
This could be a multipanel with:
1) Relationship between feces cnp and probability of being eaten by other fish (data from Robertson)
2) % of fish feces being excreted during the night (calculated combining gut volume data and bioenergetic modeling)


I digitalised Robertson's data and tested some models and it seems like phosphorus is the best predictor both to dermine whether poo is being eaten and whether a fish is a coprophage. (see below) Interesting to include in paper?

### Figure 4
A beautiful scheme showing the fluxes of organic CNP through fishes in a simplistic community (using functional groups).
I am seeing fish drawings, arrows with widths proportionate to the amount of daily poo flow.
This incorporates both flow to the benthic detritus pool and back to the other fish functional groups (notably herbivores/detrivores) through coprophagy.
The values can be based on an average across communities in French polynesia (all modeled seperately using fishflux first).


## Additional ideas

- instead of one drawing, we have two drawings showing contrasting communities: a "pristine" community and an impacted community with low complexity and a lot of fishing (lots of small herbivores, like Moorea).
- A more extensive analysis showing the effect of different community compositions on egestion rates as well as poo quality
We can use the RLS for this. I contacted Rick and Graham and got all the available community data for French Polynesia.
- Another option may be to look at time series of community-level egestion rates

## Some notes   
- There seems to be no real effect of body size or intestine morphology on assimilation efficiency. The most important predictor I find is the gut content elemental content.
